# Privacy policy

This is our current privacy policy (version 1).

### What do we know about you?

The extension is managed by your own computer - our servers only facilitate the generation of API keys towards Spotify.
This also means you have to configure the extension on each of your devices.

### What do we do with your information

Any information is stored in server RAM and never written out or send to a database. When the server crashes your information will be lost forever.

### How to remove yourself from our service

Currently we have no way of purging in-memory data on our servers.
